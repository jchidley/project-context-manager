# Session 006: v0.3.0 Feature Analysis and Planning

Date: 2025-05-26 19:45

## Key Accomplishments

- Removed duplicate update-project.md slash command that conflicted with checkpoint/wrap-session
- Analyzed /log command's hierarchical structure for potential adoption in pc
- Documented settings.local.json integration for smoother Claude Code workflows
- Set up community feedback monitoring framework for v0.3.0 development

## Discoveries

### Hierarchical Log Benefits
- The /log command uses a 3-tier structure: SUMMARY (<3KB) → RECENT → sessions/
- Auto-archives sessions over 5KB to prevent massive log files
- This directly addresses pc's original problem of 66KB+ log files
- Could be implemented while maintaining backward compatibility

### Claude Code Integration
- settings.local.json can pre-approve pc commands to eliminate permission prompts
- Project-specific tool permissions reduce friction during development
- Users can add pc commands to their project's .claude/settings.local.json

### Community Monitoring Strategy
- GitHub repository currently at 0 stars/forks (expected for day-one release)
- Need to track: GitHub issues, discussions, social media mentions
- Success metrics defined: user feedback, contributed features, blog posts

## Technical Details

### Proposed Hierarchical Structure
```
~/.project-contexts/project-name/
├── logs/
│   ├── SUMMARY.md (<3KB executive summary)
│   ├── RECENT.md (key points from recent sessions)
│   └── sessions/
│       └── SESSION_*.md (archived sessions)
```

### Recommended settings.local.json
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(pc:*)",
      "Bash(pc status:*)",
      "Bash(pc switch:*)",
      "Bash(pc todo:*)",
      "Bash(pc log:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next Session Priority

Monitor GitHub repository for community feedback and early adopter insights before starting v0.3.0 development.
