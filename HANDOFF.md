## Current State
Status: v0.2.2-ready with refactored, tested codebase
Target: Test and release clean implementation
Latest: Created modular architecture with 22 tests, shellcheck compliant

## Essential Context
- pc_refactored.sh ready to replace pc.sh after real-world testing
- Full test suite available: ./tests/bats/bin/bats tests/*.bats
- GitHub Actions CI/CD configured for automated testing
- TODO.md properly tracks v0.3.0 implementation tasks
- Two features analyzed but not implemented: hierarchical logs, settings.local.json

## Next Step
Test pc_refactored.sh with real project switching scenarios

## If Blocked
Compare behavior: pc status vs ./pc_refactored.sh status
