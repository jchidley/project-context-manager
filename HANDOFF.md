# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-05-26 15:35

## Current State
Status: v0.2.0 Released! Plain text migration complete
Target: Future enhancements and community feedback
Latest: Successfully added CI/CD, badges, and shell completions - all tests passing!

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **Critical Decision**: Migrate from SQLite to plain text TODO.md
- 16 Claude Code commands + 7 user commands all expect plain text
- SQLite prevents direct editing by humans and LLMs
- See: PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md for implementation plan

## Key Files to Read
1. **pc.sh** - Main script with plain text todo operations
2. **migrate_todos_to_plain_text.sh** - Migration tool for existing users
3. **install.sh** - Installation script
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and changes

## Next Step
Continue with future enhancements or community-requested features

## Recent Achievements
- v0.2.0 released with plain text migration
- CI/CD pipeline active and passing
- Shell completions for bash and zsh
- README badges showing version and license
