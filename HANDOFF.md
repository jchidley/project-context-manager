# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-01-26 18:45

## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - Ready for v0.2.0 plain text migration
Target: Replace SQLite with TODO.md for seamless slash command integration
Latest: Completed documentation audit and author attribution

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **Critical Decision**: Migrate from SQLite to plain text TODO.md
- 16 Claude Code commands + 7 user commands all expect plain text
- SQLite prevents direct editing by humans and LLMs
- See: PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md for implementation plan

## Key Files to Read
1. **TODO.md** - Current task list with v0.2.0 migration plan
2. **PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md** - Architecture decision details
3. **SLASH_COMMAND_INTEGRATION_FIX.md** - Why integration is broken
4. **SESSION_002_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md** - Today's discoveries

## Next Step
Create v0.2.0 branch and implement plain text todo operations

## If Blocked
Review pc_unified_prototype.sh to understand current SQLite implementation
