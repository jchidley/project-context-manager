# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-01-26 15:55

## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - ARCHITECTURE DECISION NEEDED
Target: Decide on SQLite vs plain text for todo storage
Latest: Realized SQLite creates friction for LLMs and humans

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **CRITICAL**: SQLite prevents direct file editing by humans/LLMs
- Slash commands expect plain text TODO.md files
- See PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md for analysis
- Plain text would solve integration issues naturally

## Next Step
Decide: Migrate to plain text TODO.md format? (Recommended: YES)

## If Blocked
Test plain text operations with grep/sed to verify feasibility
