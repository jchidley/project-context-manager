# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-01-26 16:05

## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - Clear path forward identified
Target: Migrate to plain text TODO.md for human/LLM compatibility
Latest: Confirmed all ~/.claude/commands/ are custom additions (not defaults)

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **All 23 commands** in ~/.claude/commands/ are custom prompt templates
- Default Claude Code commands are built-in (/help, /model, etc.)
- Custom commands expect plain text files (todo.md, plan.md)
- Plain text migration aligns perfectly with existing workflow

## Next Step
Create v0.2.0 branch to implement plain text TODO.md format

## If Blocked
Start with migration script to export existing SQLite todos
