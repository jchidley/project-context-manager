## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - Ready for v0.2.0 plain text migration
Target: Replace SQLite with TODO.md for seamless slash command integration
Latest: Completed documentation audit and author attribution

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **Critical Decision**: Migrate from SQLite to plain text TODO.md
- 16 Claude Code commands + 7 user commands all expect plain text
- SQLite prevents direct editing by humans and LLMs
- See: PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md for implementation plan

## Next Step
Create v0.2.0 branch and implement plain text todo operations
