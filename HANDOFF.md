# Project Context Manager Handoff

## Current State

We've designed and prototyped a comprehensive project context management system that solves the problem of managing multiple concurrent projects with their associated state, todos, and documentation.

## What We Built

### 1. Core Insights Documents
- **GIT_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md**: How git's patterns (stash, branches, history) apply to context management
- **GITHUB_CONTEXT_INSIGHTS.md**: Key realization that contexts â‰  projects, and how GitHub's issue/project model can enhance local workflows
- **UNIFIED_CONTEXT_PLAN.md**: The complete architectural vision combining both sets of insights

### 2. Implementation Prototypes
- **pc_prototype.sh**: Basic context switching with git awareness
- **pc_enhanced.sh**: Added stash, history, diff, and safety features
- **pc_unified_prototype.sh**: Full system with SQLite-backed todos and GitHub integration

### 3. Supporting Work
- **LOG_MANAGEMENT_*.md**: The original problem that sparked this project - managing large log files for LLM contexts
- **LOG_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: How to apply hierarchical patterns to any growing documentation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **SQLite for Todos**: Persistent task tracking that survives context switches
2. **Markdown for Context**: Human-readable state files (HANDOFF.md, etc.)
3. **Git Integration**: Respect version control boundaries, warn on dirty state
4. **GitHub Optional**: Full functionality offline, enhanced features when connected
5. **Non-Destructive**: Always backup before operations, maintain history

## Next Steps

1. **Install and Test**: 
   ```bash
   cp pc_unified_prototype.sh ~/.local/bin/pc
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pc
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**: Share this tool with others

3. **Implement Advanced Features**:
   - Wiki for shared knowledge
   - Templates for common project types
   - Editor/terminal state restoration

4. **Documentation**:
   - Usage guide with examples
   - Integration guides for various workflows
   - Video demonstration

## Problem It Solves

Developers often work on multiple projects simultaneously and lose context when switching between them. This tool provides a git-like interface to manage project-specific state, ensuring you never lose track of what you were doing.

## Origin Story

Started as a side project while working on zwift-race-finder when log files grew too large (66KB+) and were slowing down LLM context loading. The solution of hierarchical log management led to realizing we needed better project context management overall.
