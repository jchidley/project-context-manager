## Current State
Status: v0.2.2 released, v0.2.3-dev with major enhancements
Target: Release v0.2.3 with enhanced init and bug fixes
Latest: Created full Claude-ready project init, fixed grep -c bug

## Essential Context
- Enhanced `pc init` creates CLAUDE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, maskfile.md, .gitignore
- Fixed grep -c bug that caused bash syntax errors in todo operations
- Added claude-task-master as inspiration source for v0.3.0 features
- Library paths now support both dev (./lib) and installed (~/.local/share/pc/lib)
- All changes committed and ready for testing

## Next Step
Test enhanced init with various project types before v0.2.3 release

## If Blocked
Check lib/init_enhanced.sh for the new implementation details
