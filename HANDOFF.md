Latest: Implemented all three future enhancements from TODO.md

## Today's Complete Journey

### 1. v0.2.0 Plain Text Migration (COMPLETE)
- Created branch: v0.2.0-plain-text-migration
- Implemented pc.sh with plain text TODO.md operations
- Created migrate_todos_to_plain_text.sh for SQLite conversion
- Renamed files (removed _v2 suffixes)
- PR #1 merged, release created: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager/releases/tag/v0.2.0

### 2. Post-Release Enhancements (COMPLETE)
- ✅ CI/CD: .github/workflows/test.yml and release.yml
- ✅ Badges: Version and license badges in README
- ✅ Shell completions: completions/pc.bash and completions/_pc
- ✅ User Guide: Comprehensive USER_GUIDE.md with examples
- ✅ Session logging: pc session commands to prevent huge log files

### 3. v0.2.1 Enhancements (COMPLETE - 2025-05-26 17:40)
- ✅ Fixed /start command to auto-discover key files
- ✅ HANDOFF.md now auto-includes "Related Documents" section
- ✅ Added `pc todo progress` command for In Progress section
- ✅ Updated /checkpoint and /wrap-session commands

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **Critical Decision**: Migrated from SQLite to plain text TODO.md
- **Why**: 16 Claude Code + 7 user commands all expect plain text files
- **Result**: Full integration with slash commands like /do-todo, /plan

## Next Steps
- Push changes to GitHub
- Create v0.2.1 release with these improvements
- Future ideas: Consider v0.3.0 with:
  - Project templates
  - GitHub wiki integration
  - Team collaboration features

## Testing Notes
- Human workflow: Direct TODO.md editing works ✓
- LLM workflow: Claude can read/edit TODO.md ✓
- CI/CD: All tests passing ✓
- Migration: SQLite → plain text tested ✓

## If Blocked
- GitHub token needs 'workflow' scope for pushing .github/workflows
- Test failures usually due to SQLite schema mismatch in migration
- Shell completions need manual sourcing in .bashrc/.zshrc

## How to Resume This Work
If starting fresh after /clear:
```bash
cd /home/jack/tools/project-context-manager
/start
# This will read HANDOFF.md and TODO.md
```
