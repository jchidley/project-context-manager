## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - CRITICAL INTEGRATION ISSUE FOUND
Target: Fix slash command integration with pc tool
Latest: Discovered slash commands don't know about pc's context system

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **CRITICAL**: Slash commands (/start, /checkpoint) don't find planning docs or todos
- Planning docs exist but aren't discovered: TODO.md, PROJECT_WISDOM.md, etc.
- Two separate todo systems: slash commands use files, pc uses SQLite
- See SLASH_COMMAND_INTEGRATION_FIX.md for detailed analysis

## Next Step
Implement Option 1 from fix document: Update slash commands to be pc-aware

## If Blocked
Test with local modifications to ~/.claude/commands/ files first
