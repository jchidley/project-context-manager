# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-05-26 14:45

## Current State
Status: v0.2.0 Plain text migration implemented on branch
Target: Test and release v0.2.0 with full slash command integration
Latest: Renamed files, updated install script, ready for testing

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **Critical Decision**: Migrate from SQLite to plain text TODO.md
- 16 Claude Code commands + 7 user commands all expect plain text
- SQLite prevents direct editing by humans and LLMs
- See: PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md for implementation plan

## Key Files to Read
1. **pc.sh** - Main script with plain text todo operations
2. **migrate_todos_to_plain_text.sh** - Migration tool for existing users
3. **install.sh** - Installation script
4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and changes

## Next Step
Test the new implementation with both human and LLM workflows

## If Blocked
Check TODO.md for remaining v0.2.0 tasks

## How to Resume This Work
