# Project: Project Context Manager
Updated: 2025-01-26 16:00

## Current State
Status: v0.1.0 Released - Architecture decision & integration clarity gained
Target: Migrate to plain text and fix custom command integration
Latest: Identified 23 custom slash commands separate from Claude Code defaults

## Essential Context
- Repository: https://github.com/jchidley/project-context-manager
- **23 custom commands** in ~/.claude/commands/ (not Claude Code defaults)
- Custom commands form workflow: plan → execute → checkpoint
- See SLASH_COMMANDS_AUDIT.md for full analysis
- Plain text migration would align with custom command expectations

## Next Step
Create v0.2.0 branch to implement plain text TODO.md format

## If Blocked
Review custom command workflow to ensure compatibility
