# Requirements - Project Context Manager (pc)

## User Interface

### Primary Views
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool with subcommands (status, switch, init, stash, etc.)
- **Status Display**: Shows active context, recent activity, and pending work
- **Todo Management**: Interactive todo list with sections and priorities
- **Log Viewer**: Hierarchical view of session logs and summaries

### User Flows
1. **Context Switching Flow**:
   - User runs `pc switch <project>`
   - System saves current HANDOFF.md and TODO.md
   - System restores target project's context files
   - User continues work with full context

2. **Work Session Flow**:
   - User runs `pc status` to see current state
   - User works and updates todos with `pc todo add/complete`
   - User runs `pc stash` to save temporary state
   - User runs `pc log` to archive completed work

3. **Todo Management Flow**:
   - User adds tasks with natural language
   - System parses and categorizes by section
   - User marks complete with checkbox or command
   - System maintains timestamps and history

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP) âœ…
- [x] Context switching between projects
- [x] Automatic HANDOFF.md management
- [x] Plain-text TODO.md with sections
- [x] Git-aware operations (warn on uncommitted changes)
- [x] Stash/restore temporary contexts
- [x] Session-based logging with archival
- [x] Zero dependencies (pure bash)

### Should Have
- [x] Shell completions for better UX
- [x] Colorized output with formatting
- [x] Todo sections (In Progress, To Do, Done)
- [x] Backup before destructive operations
- [ ] GitHub issue synchronization
- [ ] Project templates

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Editor state preservation
- [ ] Terminal state restoration
- [ ] GitHub wiki integration
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Cross-machine sync

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Context switch: < 100ms
- Todo operations: < 50ms
- Log archival: < 200ms
- No background processes

### Data Requirements
- Storage: ~/.project-contexts/ directory
- Plain text files for all data
- No database dependencies
- Backup retention: 10 most recent

### Compatibility
- Bash 4.0+ required
- POSIX-compliant where possible
- Works in WSL, Linux, macOS
- Git integration optional

## External Integrations

### Git (Optional)
- Purpose: Detect uncommitted changes, current branch
- Method: Command-line git calls
- Fallback: Works without git

### GitHub CLI (Future)
- Purpose: Issue synchronization, wiki integration
- Method: `gh` command-line tool
- Status: Planned for v0.3.0

### Editor Integration (Future)
- Purpose: Save/restore open files and positions
- Method: Editor-specific state files
- Status: Research phase

## Constraints & Requirements

### Must Support
- Multiple concurrent projects
- Interrupted work sessions
- Plain text workflows (human-editable)
- Fast context switching
- Work state preservation

### Must Not
- Require internet connection
- Depend on external services
- Modify git repository
- Lose user data
- Require specific editor

### Security Considerations
- No sensitive data in context files
- Local-only by default
- Optional cloud features must authenticate
- Respect .gitignore patterns
