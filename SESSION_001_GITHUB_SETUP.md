# SESSION_001_GITHUB_SETUP.md

## Session Date: 2025-01-26

## Accomplishments

### 1. Created GitHub Repository
- Successfully created `jack/project-context-manager` repository on GitHub
- Set up with MIT/Apache dual license
- Added comprehensive README with project overview and usage instructions

### 2. Fixed Critical SQL Bug
- Identified and fixed SQL syntax error in `pc_unified_prototype.sh`
- Issue: Missing comma in CREATE TABLE statement for todos table
- Resolution: Added comma after `github_issue_number INTEGER` field
- Bug prevented todo functionality from working properly

### 3. Local Installation and Testing
- Installed `pc_unified_prototype.sh` as `~/.local/bin/pc`
- Verified installation with `which pc` and `pc --version`
- Tested basic functionality:
  - `pc status` - Shows no active context (expected)
  - `pc init test-project` - Creates new context
  - `pc todo add` - Now works correctly after SQL fix

### 4. GitHub Repository Enhancement
- Added descriptive topics/tags for discoverability:
  - `developer-tools`
  - `context-switching`
  - `project-management`
  - `cli`
  - `bash`
  - `productivity`

## Key Technical Details

### SQL Bug Fix
The unified prototype had a syntax error in the todos table creation:
```sql
-- Before (broken):
github_issue_number INTEGER
created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

-- After (fixed):
github_issue_number INTEGER,
created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

### Installation Process
```bash
cp pc_unified_prototype.sh ~/.local/bin/pc
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pc
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Create first GitHub release/tag (v0.1.0) for current scripts
- Test GitHub integration features (issue sync)
- Document the SQL fix in the unified prototype comments

### Short Term
- Complete todo items #1 (update Claude commands) and #3 (usage guide)
- Create example workflows for common developer scenarios
- Add error handling for edge cases discovered during testing

### Long Term
- Consider migration to compiled language (Rust) for performance
- Implement remaining features from planning documents
- Gather user feedback for UX improvements

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always test SQL**: The CREATE TABLE bug shows importance of testing database operations
2. **Local testing first**: Installing and testing locally revealed the SQL issue immediately
3. **GitHub topics matter**: Adding relevant topics improves project discoverability
4. **Documentation is key**: Clear README helps users understand the tool's purpose

## Session Summary

Successfully transitioned Project Context Manager from local development to public GitHub repository. Fixed critical bug preventing todo functionality. Tool is now installable and functional for basic context switching operations. Repository is properly tagged and discoverable.
