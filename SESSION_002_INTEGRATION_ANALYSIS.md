# Session 002: Integration Analysis & Architecture Decision
Date: 2025-01-26
Duration: ~3 hours

## Summary
Released v0.1.0, discovered critical integration issues with slash commands, and made key architecture decision to migrate from SQLite to plain text.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Released v0.1.0
- Created comprehensive release notes
- Tagged and published on GitHub
- Documented installation instructions

### 2. Discovered Integration Failure
- Slash commands couldn't find planning documents (TODO.md, PROJECT_WISDOM.md)
- Root cause: Commands expect plain text files, pc uses SQLite database
- Two separate todo systems creating friction

### 3. Slash Command Audit
- Identified 23 custom commands in ~/.claude/commands/
- 16 from Claude Code installation (planning/execution workflow)
- 7 created by Jack (session management workflow)
- NO overlap with default Claude Code built-in commands

### 4. Architecture Decision: SQLite â†’ Plain Text
- SQLite prevents direct editing by humans and LLMs
- Plain text enables git diffs and version control
- Aligns with existing slash command expectations
- Follows "plain text is universal" principle

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Created SLASH_COMMAND_INTEGRATION_FIX.md
- Created PLAIN_TEXT_MIGRATION_PROPOSAL.md
- Created SLASH_COMMANDS_AUDIT.md
- Added author attribution to all custom commands
- Updated TODO.md with v0.2.0 migration plan

## Technical Insights

### Why SQLite Failed
1. LLMs need bash commands to interact (can't directly read/write)
2. Humans can't edit in their favorite text editor
3. Git can't show meaningful diffs
4. Breaks integration with 23 existing slash commands

### Plain Text Benefits
1. Direct manipulation by Read/Write tools
2. Human-editable in any editor
3. Git-friendly with clear diffs
4. Natural integration with slash commands
5. Zero dependencies

## Next Actions (v0.2.0)
1. Create v0.2.0 branch
2. Export SQLite todos to TODO.md format
3. Implement plain text operations (grep/sed based)
4. Update all pc commands
5. Create migration guide
6. Test and release

## Lessons Learned
- "When tools don't integrate naturally, the architecture might be wrong"
- Sometimes the simple solution (plain text) is the right solution
- Align with ecosystem conventions rather than fighting them
- Integration testing would have caught this earlier
