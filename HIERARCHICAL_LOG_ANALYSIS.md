# Hierarchical Log Structure Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of the /log command's hierarchical structure for potential adoption in pc's log management.

## Current /log Command Structure

The /log command implements a three-tier hierarchy:

1. **TOPIC_LOG_SUMMARY.md** (<3KB) - Executive summary
2. **TOPIC_LOG_RECENT.md** - Key points from recent sessions  
3. **sessions/TOPIC_LOG_SESSION_YYYYMMDD_NNN.md** - Archived sessions

### Key Features
- Automatic archiving when active session exceeds 5KB
- Topic-based organization (e.g., CONNECTIQ_LOG.md, WATCHFACE_LOG.md)
- Maintains "Key Commands" section at bottom of each log
- Clear separation between active work and historical reference

## Benefits for pc Integration

1. **Scalability**: Prevents single massive log files (solves original 66KB+ problem)
2. **Quick Context**: Summary provides instant overview without reading entire history
3. **Searchability**: Topic-based files make finding specific information easier
4. **Performance**: Smaller active files mean faster reads/writes

## Proposed Implementation for pc

### Directory Structure
```
~/.project-contexts/project-name/
├── HANDOFF.md (current work state)
├── PROJECT_WISDOM.md (accumulated knowledge)
├── TODO.md (task list)
├── logs/
│   ├── SUMMARY.md (<3KB executive summary)
│   ├── RECENT.md (key points from recent sessions)
│   └── sessions/
│       ├── SESSION_001_20250526.md
│       ├── SESSION_002_20250527.md
│       └── ...
```

### Command Enhancements
- `pc log` - Append to current session with auto-archiving
- `pc log summary` - View/edit executive summary
- `pc log recent` - View recent session highlights
- `pc log search <term>` - Search across all log tiers

### Implementation Notes
- Keep current session-based approach but add hierarchy
- Auto-archive sessions over 5KB to sessions/ subdirectory
- Update RECENT.md with key points when archiving
- Maintain SUMMARY.md as high-level project chronicle

## Compatibility
- Backward compatible with existing flat log structure
- Migration script can reorganize existing logs
- Slash commands remain unchanged
