# Session 007: Code Cleanup and Test Coverage
Date: 2025-05-26

## Session Summary
Major refactoring to improve code quality, add test coverage, and ensure shellcheck compliance. Created modular architecture with 22 passing unit tests.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Modular Architecture**
   - Extracted 30+ shared functions to `lib/common.sh`
   - Split todo and stash commands into separate modules
   - Reduced main script complexity significantly

2. **Established Test Framework**
   - Set up BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)
   - Created 22 unit tests with good coverage
   - Added test helper functions and assertions

3. **Fixed Shellcheck Compliance**
   - Resolved all SC2155 warnings (declare/assign separately)
   - Fixed SC2119 warnings (function parameters)
   - Main script now passes with zero warnings

4. **Added CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing on push/PR
   - Multi-platform support (Ubuntu, macOS)

5. **Organized TODO Tracking**
   - Clarified completed analyses vs pending implementation
   - Properly tracked hierarchical logs and settings.local.json as future work
   - Reorganized TODO.md by priority and category

### Discoveries

1. **Test Coverage Reveals Issues Early**
   - BATS tests uncovered readonly variable conflicts
   - Missing assertion functions found during test writing
   - Tests ensure refactoring doesn't break functionality

2. **Shellcheck Compliance Matters**
   - SC2155 (declare/assign) can mask command failures
   - Proper error handling requires careful variable assignment
   - Following shellcheck improves script reliability

### Technical Details

**Modular Structure**:
```
pc_refactored.sh (main)
├── lib/common.sh (shared functions)
├── lib/todo_commands.sh (todo operations)
└── lib/stash_commands.sh (stash operations)
```

**Test Coverage**:
- Color definitions and formatting
- Input validation (context names)
- File operations (safe_copy, check_file)
- Context management (get/set current)
- Utility functions (timestamps, escaping)

**Key Fixes**:
```bash
# Before (SC2155 warning)
local current=$(get_current_context)

# After (compliant)
local current
current=$(get_current_context)
```

### Next Session Priority
Test pc_refactored.sh in real usage scenarios before replacing pc.sh as the main implementation.
