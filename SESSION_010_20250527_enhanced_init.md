# Session 010: Enhanced Init and Bug Fixes
Date: 2025-05-27
Version: v0.2.3-dev

## Summary
Enhanced `pc init` to create full Claude-ready project structure. Fixed grep -c bug in todo_commands.sh. Added claude-task-master as inspiration for v0.3.0 features.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced pc init Command
- Created lib/init_enhanced.sh with comprehensive project setup
- Now generates:
  - CLAUDE.md with full project instructions template
  - REQUIREMENTS.md with structured requirements format
  - maskfile.md with standard development tasks
  - .gitignore with common patterns
  - Enhanced HANDOFF.md and TODO.md in context directory
- Supports both --basic (context only) and full modes
- Initializes git repository if not present

### 2. Fixed grep -c Bug
- Issue: grep -c was returning multi-line output causing bash syntax errors
- Solution: Changed to `grep | wc -l` for reliable line counting
- Tested and confirmed working with todo complete operations

### 3. Library Path Flexibility
- Updated pc_refactored.sh to support both development and installed locations
- Libraries can be in ./lib (development) or ~/.local/share/pc/lib (installed)
- Enables seamless development and deployment

### 4. Added Inspiration Source
- Added claude-task-master to PROJECT_WISDOM.md for v0.3.0 planning
- Key ideas: task templating, progress visualization, advanced context switching

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Init Implementation
```bash
# Full Claude-ready project initialization
pc init my-project              # Creates in current directory
pc init my-project ~/projects   # Creates in specified directory
pc init my-project --basic      # Context only, no project files
```

### Bug Fix Details
```bash
# Before (problematic):
local matches=$(grep -c "pattern" file)

# After (fixed):
local matches
matches=$(grep "pattern" file | wc -l || echo 0)
```

## Next Steps
1. Test enhanced init with various project types
2. Update documentation for new init features
3. Create v0.2.3 release with these improvements
4. Study claude-task-master for v0.3.0 features
