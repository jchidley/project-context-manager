# Session 2025-05-26: v0.2.1 Claude Code Integration Enhancements

## Key Accomplishments

- **Released v0.2.1** with all planned enhancements
- **Enhanced /start command** to auto-discover TODO.md, PROJECT_WISDOM.md, and other key files
- **Added Related Documents section** to HANDOFF.md template for better context navigation
- **Implemented `pc todo progress`** command to mark tasks as in-progress with section support

## Discoveries

### Claude Code Integration Completeness
All three future enhancements were interconnected - the /start auto-discovery needed the Related Documents section, which benefited from the todo progress tracking. This created a complete integration loop between pc and Claude Code workflows.

### Rapid Release Cycle
Shipped v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 in a single day, demonstrating the power of:
- Clear planning in HANDOFF.md
- CI/CD automation
- Plain text architecture enabling fast iteration

## Technical Details

### Todo Progress Implementation
Added `todo_progress()` function that:
- Moves items from "## To Do" to "## In Progress" section
- Preserves item metadata with timestamps
- Maintains section organization in TODO.md

```bash
# Mark task as in-progress
pc todo progress "auth"

# Creates/updates "## In Progress" section
- [>] Implement auth feature <!-- started:2025-05-26 17:30 -->
```

### Slash Command Updates
Modified three commands to include auto-discovery:
- `/start` - Reads multiple files in priority order
- `/checkpoint` - Adds Related Documents section
- `/wrap-session` - Ensures Related Documents populated

### File Discovery Pattern
```bash
# Priority order for /start command
1. HANDOFF.md (always primary)
2. TODO.md (if exists)
3. PROJECT_WISDOM.md (if referenced)
4. CLAUDE.md (project instructions)
5. README.md (project overview)
```

## Next Session Priority

Monitor community adoption and feedback for v0.3.0 planning. The project is feature-complete for v0.2.x series.
