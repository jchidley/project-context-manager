# Slash Command Attribution

## Commands Created by Jack Chidley

The following custom slash commands were created to establish a session management workflow:

| Command | Creation Date | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `/log` | 2025-05-23 | First custom command - document session learnings |
| `/tool` | 2025-05-25 08:00 | Build tools following development standards |
| `/update-project` | 2025-05-25 19:32 | Update project documentation comprehensively |
| `/review-status` | 2025-05-25 19:37 | Review project state after compacting |
| `/wrap-session` | 2025-05-25 19:56 | End session and archive work |
| `/checkpoint` | 2025-05-25 20:11 | Quick state capture during work |
| `/start` | 2025-05-25 20:54 | Begin or continue work session |

## Workflow Evolution

The commands were developed in this order:
1. `/log` - Recognized need to document sessions
2. `/tool` - Standardize tool development
3. `/update-project` & `/review-status` - Project state management
4. `/wrap-session` - Clean session endings
5. `/checkpoint` - Frequent state saves
6. `/start` - Consistent session beginnings

This creates the full workflow: start → checkpoint (multiple) → log → wrap-session
