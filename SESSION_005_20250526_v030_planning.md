# Session 005: v0.3.0 Planning and Slash Command Analysis
Date: 2025-05-26
Time: 18:00-18:20

## Session Overview
After successfully releasing v0.2.1, transitioned to planning v0.3.0 features and analyzed the Claude slash command ecosystem for integration opportunities and duplication.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Organized v0.3.0 Roadmap
- Consolidated future enhancement ideas from README.md into TODO.md
- Prioritized features based on community needs and technical feasibility
- Removed editor state preservation feature per user request

### 2. Slash Command Ecosystem Analysis
- Explored all commands in ~/.claude/commands/ directory
- Identified key patterns and conventions:
  - Plain text files (TODO.md, plan.md, *_LOG.md) are standard
  - Session-based workflows with progressive documentation
  - Hierarchical log structure for managing large documentation

### 3. Found Critical Duplication
- **update-project.md** duplicates functionality of checkpoint.md and wrap-session.md
- All three update project docs, but update-project lacks the HANDOFF.md workflow
- Recommendation: Remove update-project.md to eliminate confusion

## Discoveries

### Complementary Relationship
- **pc (project-context-manager)**: Infrastructure for managing contexts across projects
- **Slash commands**: Workflows for creating content within projects
- They work together: pc stores/retrieves what slash commands create

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Hierarchical Log Structure**: The /log command uses a smart archiving system that pc could adopt
2. **File Conventions**: pc already aligns with slash command expectations (TODO.md, HANDOFF.md, etc.)
3. **Session Management**: Both systems use session-based work patterns

## Technical Details

### Slash Command Overlap Analysis
| Command | Function | Overlap with pc |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| /plan | Creates plan.md and todo.md | pc manages these files |
| /do-todo | Works through todo.md items | pc stores/switches todo.md |
| /log | Manages *_LOG.md with hierarchy | pc includes logs in context |
| /session-summary | Creates session summaries | pc manages session logs |

### v0.3.0 Feature Priority
1. High: Remove update-project.md, monitor community feedback
2. Medium: Hierarchical logs, GitHub wiki integration, terminal state
3. Low: Project templates, team collaboration

## Next Session Priority
Remove update-project.md slash command to eliminate duplication with checkpoint/wrap-session

## Session Complete

Project: Project Context Manager
Progress: v0.2.1 released, v0.3.0 roadmap organized, slash commands analyzed
Next Priority: Remove update-project.md slash command

Ready to compact!

To continue next session:
1. Start with: "Continue project-context-manager. Read HANDOFF.md"
2. Or for full context: "Continue project-context-manager. Read HANDOFF.md and SESSION_005_20250526_v030_planning.md"
