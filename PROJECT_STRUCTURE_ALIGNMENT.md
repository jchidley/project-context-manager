# Project Structure Alignment Report

Date: 2025-05-27
Purpose: Align project-context-manager with CLAUDE_PROJECT_SETUP_GUIDE.md recommendations

## Summary of Changes

### Documents Created
1. **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Comprehensive requirements document covering:
   - User interface and flows
   - Core functionality (MVP, Should Have, Nice to Have)
   - Technical requirements and performance targets
   - External integrations (Git, GitHub CLI)
   - Constraints and security considerations

### Documents Updated
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Added missing sections:
   - Technical Stack section (Bash, Bats, ShellCheck, mask)
   - Constraints & Requirements section
   - Performance targets
   - Security considerations

### Already Compliant
1. **HANDOFF.md** - Well-structured with current state, next steps, blockers
2. **TODO.md** - Excellent organization with priorities and timestamps
3. **maskfile.md** - Comprehensive task automation already in place

## Alignment Status

### âœ… Fully Aligned (5/5 Essential Documents)
- CLAUDE.md - Project instructions with all recommended sections
- REQUIREMENTS.md - Complete requirements specification
- HANDOFF.md - Current work state tracking
- maskfile.md - Task automation
- TODO.md - Task management with priorities

### Additional Strengths
- Project already uses mask for task automation (ahead of guide)
- TODO.md includes timestamps (better than template)
- HANDOFF.md includes recovery instructions
- Comprehensive test suite with Bats
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Next Steps
1. Consider consolidating some of the many analysis/planning docs into the core 5
2. Use REQUIREMENTS.md to guide v0.3.0 feature development
3. Update HANDOFF.md and TODO.md to reference new REQUIREMENTS.md

## Benefits of Alignment
- Clear project purpose and constraints in CLAUDE.md
- Comprehensive requirements tracking in REQUIREMENTS.md
- Consistent structure for Claude to work uninterrupted
- All essential context in standardized locations
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
